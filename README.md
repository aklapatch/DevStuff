## Standalone gdb frontends (list [here](https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/GDB%20Front%20Ends))
+ [gdbgui](https://github.com/cs01/gdbgui/): browser based frontend for C++, rust and other languages.
  Works well, but it is in a browser. It can be installed with pip.
  
+ [Nemiver](http://home.gna.org/nemiver): GNOME based frontend (tried it and it may be buggy)

## Code editors
+ [oni2](https://github.com/onivim/oni2): currently alpha, nvim IDE that might be based on a native implementation of electron.
